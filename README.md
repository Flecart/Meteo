# Meteo project
This is a front end web-app project. 
This was my first programming project when i was self-teaching HTML CSS and JS programming in the
time when i was still at high school. 

## How is it made
This project was made using vanilla CSS and JS, no other framework used. All animations are made by me.

### NOTE:
The notes here are written two years after the project, i'm looking back at my own mistakes.
- this was one of my first projects, i know that the programming style i used wasn't one of the most readable ones. 
- i know i have the API key exposed but at the time i didn't even know what it was! Now i know the necessity to keep it secret.
- At the time i didn't know how to use git as you can see from the commit history
